## CSE 326 - Information System Design
**Online Event Management Platform**

Nowadays, be it an online event session, or in person events like concert, workshop, drama, and what not- you will find out about those events through social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. The most common sight we can see is Facebook event pages being created and shared across the social media giant. No matter how big and flexible it is, Facebook event pages have major drawbacks. It is common to find people posting event descriptions, and then an external link for the event registration. Not just that, payments required for that event have to be paid manually. And then, after validating the payment transaction, the event organizer usually notifies the person about their registration completion. In person events are also hard to find- to ease this issue, usually Google Map location is also provided along with the event description. Going through different places just to get a ticket for an event is something that shouldnâ€™t exist. We suggest a single platform for all these tasks, acting as a one-stop solution. An online event management platform for both organizers and users. A place where users will be able to explore different events, pay through a single gateway, and register instantly.
